# NetControl

NetControl is an application for Android that empowers users to regain control over their devices by blocking internet traffic to and from selected applications. By eliminating Internet access, the app ensures that other apps that don't necessarily need internet access cannot transmit any data, providing a robust security measure against unauthorized data sharing. NetControl addresses the common concern of unauthorized data sharing and offers a straightforward method for enhancing personal data security. The app features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to protect their sensitive data with ease. Many applications unnecessarily request Internet access, often to display advertisements or send data to remote servers; this app provides a simple yet effective solution. Users can effortlessly select the applications they wish to block without needing technical knowledge of IP addressing, ports, or packet filtering.
