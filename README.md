NetControl is completely different from all other VPN Firewalls. NetControl requires NO Internet permissions. Without permissions CANNOT send any data anywhere. We intercept no allowed user traffic. 

Please do not send any requests for customisation that would require NetControl to inspect a users traffic. We leave that to all the other Android Firewalls.
